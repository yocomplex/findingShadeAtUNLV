# findingShadeAtUNLV

Description:
For all the brave students that survived the brutal summer at UNLV. Of course the only buildings that
are open in the summer are: Thomas Beam Engineering Complex (TBE) and the Student Union (SU). You
want to reach the student union from the TBE building. To make matters worse, thereâ€™s construction
happening on campus as well which limits the paths you can take from TBE to the SU. Fortunately there
are buildings you can sit behind to get some shade to avoid passing out. You are given a stamina amount
and each edge takes you from one building to another, the longer edge uses up more stamina. You must find
a path (if exists) that leads you from TBE to SU such that when you arrive at the SU you have at least one
unit of stamina left that gives you energy to buy a passion fruit ice tea at Starbucks.

Credits:
Shoutout to my professor, Dr. James Andro Vasko, for creating this fun project. I enjoyed creating the main file that gives you a simulation of getting from the TBE to the SU within one unit of stamina(if possible). This program was designed to use adjacency lists, hashmaps, and a Depth First Search type of traversal.

How to:
You run the program with the main file using linux file redirection. In the terminal you use, "main.out < <input#>.txt"
Note that the input text files are numbered from 1-6 so change the "#" to the corresponding input you want to use.
